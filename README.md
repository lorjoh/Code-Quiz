# Quiz Code Challenge

I found this quite challenging. As a result, a few of the features are not working.


#Issues

##Functions
In the ##getStarted, ##quizWelcome introduces the app and ##Timer starts 1000millisecond per click of the Start-Button.
I could not get the ##timeReduced to run but I was able to  get the ##getQuizOptions and ##getAnswer working together. 
I could not get the ##getInitials to show depite hiding the preceeding containers.
I also could not get HighScore active.
